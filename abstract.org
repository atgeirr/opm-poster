* The "Open Porous Media Initiative" (OPM) Software
[2016-12-12 Mo 20:52]

In this poster we will give an overview of the "Open Porous Media
Initiative" (OPM, http://opm-project.org) software and open data modules. It is a collaborative
effort of both academia and industry to foster collaboration between
both and thus facilitate innovation using an open source approach. The
current development focus is CO2 sequestration and improved and
enhanced oil recovery. Among the contributors are Dr. Blatt ­
HPC­Simulation­Software & Services, IRIS, NTNU, poware.de, SINTEF,
Statoil AS, University of Bergen, University of Stuttgart.


The OPM software, in part based on DUNE (http://dune-project.org), contains various solvers for
porous media flow (IMPES, two-phase incompressible transport, a
reordering-based two-phase polymer solver, and a parallel fully
implicit black-oil solver). In addition solvers for flow-based
upscaling of both permeability (single-phase upscaling) and relative
permeability (two-phase upscaling), including capability for
steady-state upscaling are included. For the fast and easy
visualization of reservoir simulations it also provides the tool
ResInsight. Together with the software OPM provides various SPE test
data sets, and the data of the Norne oil field as open data to allow
easy experiments and benchmarking.
