Standard Well Model:
Relatively simple
Assuming uniform fluid compsitions within wellbore (resulting from a single set of primary variables)
Supporting crossflow
Adequate in describing the majority of wells in reservoir simulations.


Multisegment Well Model:
Wellbore is discretized with segments
A set of primary variables is introduced for each segment
Supporting multilateral wells in a natural way
More detailed, flexible and accurate well bore simulation
